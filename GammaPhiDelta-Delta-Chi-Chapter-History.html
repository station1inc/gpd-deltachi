<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-2">Gamma Phi Delta Sorority, Inc. was founded in Detroit, Mich., in February 1943 at the Lewis College of Business (formerly Lewis Business College) by Elizabeth Garner, an instructor at the college, and her sister, Dr. Violet T. Lewis, founder and president of the college. The women formed Gamma Phi Delta Sorority to support and promote opportunities for young women who were striving for a better education. 
<br>
<br>Gamma Phi Delta Sorority is a sisterhood of distinguished, congenial business and professional women. Through their talents and qualities, members aid and cultivate higher scholastic and ethical standards, provide social and recreational outlets, implement enrichment programs for youth and administer services to people in need. The Sorority provides opportunities for members to work and serve on local, regional and national levels, developing productive relationships and fostering positive results. Gamma Phi Delta is an excellent vehicle to build positive relationships with women with similar aspirations throughout the U.S. and internationally. 
<br>
<br>The Sorority is comprised of chapters in seven regions throughout the United States: Far Western, Mid-Western, Eastern, Northern, Southern, South Atlantic and Quad States.
<br>
<br>Additionally, each Gamma Phi Delta Sorority Chapter supports and participates in the "Five Point Program" - M.E.E.P.S.

<br>Delta Chi  Chapter's  mission is to: Improve the economic, social and political status of all women; to encourage our members to further their education and training and maintain a progressive interest in the values of humanity; to promote refinement and culture; to establish and maintain a better relationship among woman of all races and creeds and to be of greater service to our community, our country and to each other.
<br><br>Delta Chi Chapter was chartered January 2, 1967 in Los Angeles, California, dedicated to the ideals and goals of the national organization.  Our active membership includes two members who were involved since the inception, They are Anne M. Mozee and   La Verne Wilson.

<br>
<br>Artist of Tomorrow is our annual scholarship fundraiser designed to showcase and award our youth with scholarships for college.
<br><br>Delta Chi Chapter's first Artist of Tomorrow was 1972 held at Victory Baptist Church and every year since 1972 we have presented a Delta Chi Scholarship to our graduating  Phi-Teens. 
<br><br>In 1997 It was renamed the Rosetta L. Wilkerson Scholarship for females students and Joe Weakley Scholarship for males students.
<br><br>In 2012 we celebrated our 40th anniversary of providing community service involvement and educational support in the form of scholarships to young people. <br><br>Our support of youth also provides cultural and social activities such as visits to museums, plays,  and fun outings such as skate parties and movie viewing.  We have also travel to many states with our youth to attend Gamma Phi Delta Sorority's National Conventions. Where our Phi-Teens, Rosebuds, Cavaliers and Junior Cavaliers have received the honor of being recipients of the  Gamma Phi Delta Sorority International Titles and Scholarships.   
<br>
<br>Delta Chi is actively involved in numerous community service efforts throughout the greater Los Angeles area in addition to supporting our youth auxiliaries. 
<br><br>Projects over the years include:
<br>
<br>·        Our Annual Thanksgiving Project, where we provide at least 50 recyclable grocery sacks of complete meals and a supermarket gift card to purchase a turkey or ham for community residents.
<br>
